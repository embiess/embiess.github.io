            Hi,
        </p>
        <p>
            My name is Michael (or Mike) Smale and this is my online portfolio that contains the bits 'n pieces that interest me. The word 'embiess' is derived by making an acronym out of my initials (MBS) to make a unique if somewhat obscure identity for myself.

            I have been interested in many aspects of media for some time having been a 'happy snapper' from my late teens. I have also been involved in web site development since 1995 and amatuer video production since 2002. My first car (such as it was) was paid for by the funds raised by painting wall murals as a teenager in venues located in Townsville and most recently I have bought a piano and am learning to play it. Sadly I am unable to sing. ;-)

            I have to thank my family (especially my late mother) for their encouragement of my creative exploits as well as my art teachers from school who nurtured my early artistic exploits. My thanks also goes out to my friend Stuart and Rob who have sparked and supported my interests in video editing and photography.
        </p>

            I also appreciate the support and friendship of Geoff who helps keep me and others I support on-line.  The bagel and coffee economy is alive and well in this regard!
        </p>
        <p>
            Final thanks goes to children Nathan and Brittany who support me (and make sure I  don't buy too many toys) to further my creative endeavours.
        </p>
        <p>
            Enjoy!<br />
            Mike
